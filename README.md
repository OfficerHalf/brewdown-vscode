# UPDATE
I'm deprecating this in favor of [homebrewery-vscode](https://github.com/OfficerHalf/homebrewery-vscode), which provides the same functionality with a more familiar syntax. I have no plans to fix any issues here.

# brewdown-vscode
Adds the [brewdown](https://github.com/trwolfe13/brewdown) markdown-it plugin to VS Code's markdown preview, as well as a command to render brewdown.
